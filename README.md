## 💎 The Engineering HUD
The Auditor is presented through a bespoke, high-density **Command Center**. Designed for elite security operations, it features:
- **Neural Archive:** Persistent local storage of previous scans.
- **Live SSE Terminal:** Real-time execution logs with zero-latency streaming.
- **Architectural Bento:** A 12-column grid layout for high-speed signal processing.

## 🛠️ Technical Orchestration
Polyglot Auditor doesn't just match patterns; it understands **infrastructure relationships**.

1. **Volatile Memory Cloning:** Bypasses GitHub API limits by cloning repositories into temporary container RAM.
2. **Multi-Layered Extraction:** Automatically prioritizes `Dockerfile`, `.tf`, `k8s/*.yaml`, and `package.json`.
3. **Dual-Engine Reasoning:** Combines **Trivy** (Deterministic CVEs) with **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Heuristic Logic Traps).

## 🚀 Absolute Noob Guide (Step-by-Step Setup)

Welcome! If you've never run a technical project like this before, follow these steps exactly.

### 1. Install the Foundations
You need three pieces of software installed on your computer:
1. **Node.js (v20 or higher):** Download and install the "LTS" version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Git:** Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **Docker Desktop:** Download and install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). *Make sure Docker is running before you start the audit.*

### 2. Get Your AI Brain (Gemini API Key)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **"Get API Key"** on the left sidebar.
4. Copy your key. **Keep it secret!**

### 3. Clone the Project
Open your computer's **Terminal** (or Command Prompt) and type these commands:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wasifshaffaq/devops-polyglot-auditor
cd devops-polyglot-auditor
```

### 4. Configure the Backend
We need to tell the app your API key:
1. Navigate into the `backend` folder.
2. Create a new file named `.env`.
3. Open `.env` in a text editor and paste this line (replace `your_key_here` with your actual key):
```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 5. Install Everything
Run this command from the **root directory** (the main `devops-polyglot-auditor` folder):
```bash
# This installs dependencies for the Backend, Landing Page, and HUD all at once
npm install
```

### 6. Launch the System
Run this command from the **root directory**:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Backend, Landing Page, and Auditor HUD all at once.

If you prefer to run them separately, you can use:
*   **Backend:** `npm run backend`
*   **Landing:** `npm run landing`
*   **HUD:** `npm run frontend`

### 7. Start Auditing
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Click **START AUDIT**.
3. Paste a GitHub link (e.g., `https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat`) and hit **RUN ENGINE**.
